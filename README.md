# Dashboard-Creation-Cloud-Calculation
In this project, I build a dashboard summarizing the Northwind Database. It is a sample database that is shipped along with Microsoft Access. The data is about “Northwind Traders”, a fictional company. The database contains all sales transactions between the company and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers.

create one table per CSV file
load the data into the database
create foreign keys to connect the tables
answer questions on the data in SQL
upload the data to a cloud database
build an interactive dashboard on a cloud server
